⚡Bio-Copilot is a project that provides an available multi-agent system for life sciences under a data-intelligence-intensive scientific research paradigm.⚡ [[Paper Link]](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.19.594895)

## ✨ Latest News
- About codes of Bio-Copilot. We are preparing for the code release, which will be available in the future!
- [19/05/2024]: Release the code generated by agent and human for HLCA task.

## 🤔 Motivation
- Currently, there is no available multi-agent system for complex tasks in the field of bioinformatics. The tasks in bioinformatics are generally characterized by a large amount of personalized data processing, which the existing multi-agent systems cannot handle.
- The Bio-Copilot, based on the paradigm introduced in the paper, has built a complete multi-agent system capable of handling complex bioinformatics tasks, and also incorporates humans as an important role.
