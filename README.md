âš¡DII-MAS is a project that provides an available multi-agent system for life sciences under a data-intelligence-intensive scientific research paradigm.âš¡ [[Paper Link]]()

## âœ¨ Latest News
- About codes of DII-MAS. We are preparing for the code release, which will be available in the future!
- [19/05/2024]: Release the code generated by agent and human for HLCA task.

## ðŸ¤” Motivation
- Currently, there is no available multi-agent system for complex tasks in the field of bioinformatics. The tasks in bioinformatics are generally characterized by a large amount of personalized data processing, which the existing multi-agent systems cannot handle.
- The DII-MAS, based on the paradigm introduced in the paper, has built a complete multi-agent system capable of handling complex bioinformatics tasks, and also incorporates humans as an important role.
